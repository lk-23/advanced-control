# District Heating Network

This project explores different simulation approaches for optimizing and controlling a District Heating Network (DHN).

A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to determine the optimal operation and resource allocation.

Subsequently, various control strategies are developed and tested, including a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based controller, to further improve performance under dynamic operating conditions.

## Input Data

The project draws inspiration from the [CityLearn](https://www.citylearn.net/) framework, which provides an environment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in building energy coordination.  
While CityLearn primarily focuses on electrical energy systems, its concepts and structure are adapted here to explore similar coordination strategies in the context of district heating.
