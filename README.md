# Advanced Control Systems

This repository provides a structured collection of **modeling, control, and optimization projects** for learning and applying modern control techniques in **Python**.  

Each notebook or module includes:
- Mathematical derivations  
- Implementation using open-source tools  
- Closed-loop simulations and visualizations
